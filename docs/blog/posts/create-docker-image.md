### Create a new image from a container's changes

- Usage:

  - Docker commit [OPTIONS] CONTAINER [REPOSITORY[:TAG]]

e.g: Get a busy box image and create a file inside container

```
docker run --name base1 -it busybox
Unable to find image 'busybox:latest' locally
latest: Pulling from library/busybox
d9cbbca60e5f: Pull complete
Digest: sha256:836945da1f3afe2cfff376d379852bbb82e0237cb2925d53a13f53d6e8a8c48c
Status: Downloaded newer image for busybox:latest
/ #mkdir -p /data/html
vi index.html
<h1>Busybox httpd server. </h1>
```

In another terminal create a new image and check it

```
docker commit -p  -a "rayx1" -m "a base image with index.html" base1
docker image ls
REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED              SIZE
<none>              <none>              64e381aeac90        55 seconds ago       1.22MB
```

you will see a un-named image. To tag a image use `docker tag`

```
Usage:  docker tag SOURCE_IMAGE[:TAG] TARGET_IMAGE[:TAG]

Create a tag TARGET_IMAGE that refers to SOURCE_IMAGE
```

e.g tag it to user rayx1 with name httpd-busybox and tag v0.1

```
docker tag 64e381aeac90 rayx1/httpd-busybox:v0.1
```

Also you could use multiple tags

```
docker tag rayx1/httpd-busybox:v0.1 rayx1/httpd:latest
```

You will see:

```
REPOSITORY            TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
rayx1/httpd-busybox   v0.1                64e381aeac90        6 minutes ago       1.22MB
rayx1/httpd           latest              64e381aeac90        6 minutes ago       1.22MB
```

You could remove a tag with image rm

```
docker image rm rayx1/httpd
Untagged: rayx1/httpd:latest
```

You can change docker file fields

```
docker inspect base1

[
    {
        ...
        "Config": {
            ...
            "Cmd": [
                "sh"
            ],
            ...
        },

    }
]
```

Create a new image with Cmd start a httpd with version v0.2

```
docker commit -a "rayx1 <ray@myemail.com>" -c 'CMD ["/bin/httpd", "-f", "-h", "/data/html"]' -p base1 rayx1/httpd-busybox:v0.2
```

### Run the new image

docker run : Run a command in a **new** container

`docker run --name base2 rayx1/httpd-busybox:v0.2` Use `docker inspect base2` get the ipaddress
`"IPAddress": "172.17.0.3",` and you can check the http with `lynx 172.17.0.3`

### start/stop/restart

`docker start|stop|restart [OPTIONS] CONTAINER [CONTAINER...]` Options:

```
Options:
  -a, --attach               Attach STDOUT/STDERR and forward signals
      --detach-keys string   Override the key sequence for detaching a container
  -i, --interactive          Attach container's STDIN
```

Note: You can not re-run a container image again. You have to start/stop/restart your container. `container run` only
can be used for start a **new** container

### login into docker hub and push the image

`docker login -u rayx1` `docker push rayx1/httpd-busybox`

note you can also login into other docker image registry. e.g to login into aliyun docker
`docker login -u rayx1 registry.cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com` and push
`docker push registry.cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/rayx1/httpd-busybox:v0.2`

### Export and import (save/load) your local docker image (without push to server)

If you'd like to distribute your images to your teammate without push to a server (maybe, for testing purpose)

#### Export

`docker save [OPTIONS] IMAGE [IMAGE...]` e.g pack http-busybox into httpd.**gz**
`docker save -o httpd.gz rayx1/httpd-busybox:v0.2` or multiple image into a file
`docker save -o httpd.gz rayx1/httpd-busybox:v0.2 rayx1/busybox`

#### import

`docker load -i httpd.gz`
